## 🧠 Problem Overview – What is TSP?

The **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** is a classic NP-hard problem in computer science.  
Goal: Find the **shortest possible route** that visits all given cities exactly once and returns to the origin city.

TSP has real-world applications in:
- 📦 Logistics  
- 🚛 Transportation  
- 🌐 Communication Network Design
